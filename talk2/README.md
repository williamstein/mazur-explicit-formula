These are the notes for a talk.  I made them using a self-contained environment that uses deck.js, twitter bootstrap, jquery, and mathjax.

Question: What kind of environment one needs to use your talk layout? I noticed a .coffee file.

Answer: Just git clone the repo, cd into the talk2 directory, and if you happen to edit "index.coffee" then type "coffee -c index.coffee" to rebuild index.js.  Absolutely everything else about the environment is 100% static -- just point your browser at index.html.
