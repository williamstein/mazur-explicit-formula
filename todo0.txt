[ ] Write code (explicit.pyx) to automate computation of each of the
    following:

  * Animation that illustrates behavior of the mean of raw data, for
    various curves.

  * Animations that illustrate computing sums over zeros for elliptic
    curves having various interesting symmetric power L-function
    properties.

  * Race four types of primes... for two elliptic curves.

[ ] Run code for interesting curves, using powerful computers.
