[x] example that illustrates embedding animation in pdf, so that we'll
    generate graphs that are useful.

[ ] Write code (explicit.pyx) to automate computation of each of the
    following.  Each animation will be generated and stored as a
    single pdf file, with 1 page per frame.

  * Animation that illustrates behavior of the mean of raw data, for
    various curves.

  * Animations that illustrate computing sums over zeros for elliptic
    curves having various interesting symmetric power L-function
    properties.

  * Race four types of primes... for two elliptic curves.

[ ] Run code for interesting curves, using powerful computers.
